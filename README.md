# Measuring the Concentration of Power in Optimism

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources related to evaluating the influence and power concentration within the Optimism Collective. The repository is organized into two main branches:

1. **Influence_calculator_frontend:** Contains the code for the Influence Calculator frontend.
2. **calculation_HHI_and_CPI:** Contains data sources and the code for calculating the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and the Concentration of Power Index (CPI).

## Branches

### Influence_calculator_frontend
This branch includes the codebase for the Influence Calculator, a frontend tool that allows community members to evaluate the influence of Houses, Councils, and Committees (HCCs) based on six key parameters.

### calculation_HHI_and_CPI
This branch contains the datasets and scripts used to calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and the Concentration of Power Index (CPI) within the Optimism ecosystem. The calculations are based on data from various sources, offering a comprehensive view of power distribution.
